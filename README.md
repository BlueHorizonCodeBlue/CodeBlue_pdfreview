Refined Prompt:

"Please review the uploaded document and provide a detailed analysis, adhering to the following formatting guidelines:

For each recommendation, specify the paragraph number, page number, and suggested rewrite, as per the style guide rules.
Ensure the recommendations are presented in clear, numbered lists or bullet points for easy readability.
Use professional Australian English, ensuring correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
Structure the analysis by including sections such as 'Style Recommendations,' 'Word Choice Suggestions,' 'Structural Improvements,' and 'Other Considerations' (where applicable).
Provide a short summary for each section, outlining the key observations.
Ensure the output is formatted with clear headings, consistent indentation, and adequate line spacing for a government-setting document.
The analysis should focus on readability, professionalism, and adherence to standard writing conventions without altering the original meaning of the text."

Breakdown of Changes:
Professional Structure: The document is now divided into sections with clear headings like "Style Recommendations," "Word Choice Suggestions," etc., making it easier to navigate.
Numbered Lists/Bullet Points: Helps in better visual structuring for quick reference.
Grammar and Spelling: Australian English conventions (e.g., "realise" instead of "realize") ensure consistency.
Readable Format: Emphasis on line spacing, indentation, and clarity of presentation for a formal setting.
This version keeps the analysis intact but ensures that the output is more polished, clear, and professional for use in a government context.
